# AI Governance Readiness in Public Universities

This repository accompanies a research article examining organisational readiness
to integrate artificial intelligence into governance processes in public universities.

## Methodological approach
- Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM)
- Predictive validation using PLSpredict
- Machine learning robustness checks

## Theoretical foundation
The analysis is grounded in organisational readiness theory (Weiner, 2009),
distinguishing change efficacy (capability) from change commitment and legitimacy.

## Repository content
This repository contains:
- Aggregated empirical results
- Figures and tables reported in the manuscript
- Reproducible analytical scripts (without raw data)

## Data availability
Raw survey data are not publicly available due to confidentiality and ethical constraints.
Only aggregated results and methodological materials are shared.
